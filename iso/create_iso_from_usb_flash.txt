To create an image from a drive
sudo dd if=/dev/sdx of=/path/to/new.iso

Alternatively, to create a USB drive from an image
sudo dd if=/path/to/iso of=/dev/sdx

Replace /dev/sdx with your USB drive, e.g. /dev/sdc.

WARNING: It is imperative that you make certain you are using the correct drive. If you don't use the correct drive, you could lose your data. To check your currently mounted drives, use the command lsblk.

Note: Copying large files (1 GB or higher) can take a long time, be patient.
